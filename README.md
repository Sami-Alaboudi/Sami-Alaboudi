# Nice to see üëÄ you here , I go by Sami Alaboudi!üëã

My first introduction to programing began in highschool after I took an intdroductory course in python. Although at the time I enjoyed it, It had not crossed my mind as a potential carreer path given my wide array of interests at the time. Fast forward to today and I am currently pursuing an undergrad in Computer Engineering at Carleton University, which with the luxury of hindsight made perfect sense given my interest in mathematics, love of problem solving(which engineering will allow for at scale) and art background in my early youth.

I beleive engineering & design is the highest form of a combinination between creativity and problem solving that one can partake in. I am someone who beleives in taking a lot of pride in my work and genuinely enjoy learning of any kind. My favorite programming language is by far is C, because I beleive it does an excellent job of forcing a programmer to think like a programmer while giving insight into how a computer actually works, unlike pythonüòÖ. 

Although I am still narrowing down what specific field of technology I want to work in, I want to work in a high paced and challenging enviroment that will force me to grow such as the one found in a startup or high impact company. Some fields that i'd look forward to working in include Mechatronics/Robotics, App-Development, Front-End Web development and DevOps. 

As of now I am currently seeking & open for an oppurunuity to work in the coming summer quarter as soon as April 28th 2025. Note I am open to other time slots as well such in the fall given enough notice.
