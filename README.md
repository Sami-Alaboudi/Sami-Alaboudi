# Hi There! Nice to see üëÄ you here , I'm Sami Alaboudi!üëã
I‚Äôm a Computer Systems Engineering student at Carleton University, heading into my final year.

I love building systems ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs programming in C/C++, Python, tinkering with embedded devices, or experimenting with front-end development using HTML, CSS. I recently worked on an IoT snow shoveling system (yes, Canadian winters inspired that one), among other things! üòÉ 

I‚Äôm especially interested in robotics, problem-solving, and finding ways to create things that actually help people. While I‚Äôm still exploring exactly where I fit ‚Äî whether it's embedded systems, robotics, Front-end Web design or something I haven‚Äôt mentioned or am yet to discover ‚Äî I know that without a doubt I love the field of Engineering, learning, understanding how things work, and the feeling of having solved a challenging problem.

Outside of coding, school and work, you‚Äôll probably find me reading, sketching, playing strategy games like chess and poker, or hanging out with friends & cats!

I‚Äôm currently looking for internship opportunities for summer 2025. I‚Äôd love to be part of a collaborative, hands-on team where I can learn, contribute, and help tackle real-world problems ‚Äî and I absolutely cannot wait to get started in the workplace!
